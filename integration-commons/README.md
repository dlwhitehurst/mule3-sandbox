# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to share common Java classes (e.g. custom transformers), 
mappings (to and from canonical data model), XML snippets (error handling, flows, subflows, object stores), 
RAML (schemas for canonical data model) and more. The shared resources here are common to all MuleSoft
integration projects at Acme Corporation.
